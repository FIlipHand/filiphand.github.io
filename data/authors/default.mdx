Hello, My name in Filip (you can use Phillip for Phil too!). I have Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Master's degree in Data Science.
I'm a PhD student at AGH University of Science and Technology. I try to do research in LLMs and their use in medicine.
Right now I'm interested in optimizing LLM inference and making them as fast as possible (saying "*going brrr*" is kind of cringe now imo so I'm not using it).

As a president of one-person **Institute of Poorly Optimized GPU Code** i want so share my journey, projects and some resources that I'm using to learn about inference optimization
and broader LLM related topics.

Hope someone will find it useful!
