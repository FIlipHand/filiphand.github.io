## Elevator pitch
This project aims to demonstrate and benchmark various modern techniques for accelerating neural network model inference. 
Through hands-on implementation and rigorous profiling, the project will showcase how combining multiple optimization strategies—from low-level 
GPU kernel optimization to high-level model restructuring—can achieve significant speedups in real-world inference scenarios. The work will include detailed 
performance analysis using PyTorch profilers and NVIDIA's NCU (NVIDIA Compute Utility).

## Project Objectives

- Understand Performance Bottlenecks: Use profiling tools to identify where computation time is actually spent in model inference
- Implement Multiple Optimization Techniques: Apply a range of techniques from compilation to kernel-level optimization
- Quantify Improvements: Measure and compare performance gains from each technique independently and in combination
- Create Educational Documentation: Provide clear explanations of each technique and practical guidance for implementation
- Demonstrate Trade-offs: Show how different optimizations affect accuracy, memory usage, and latency

## Scope and Techniques
### Baseline and Profiling
- Select a target model (e.g., a transformer-based language model or vision model)
- Establish baseline inference metrics (latency, throughput, memory usage)
- Use PyTorch Profiler and NVIDIA NCU to identify performance bottlenecks
- Document which operations consume the most compute time

### Inference-Specific Optimizations
- KV Caching - Implement efficient key-value cache management for autoregressive generation
- Batch inference
- Speculative decoding - draft token generation using a smaller model
- Attention Optimization - Implement or integrate FlashAttention or similar memory-efficient attention mechanisms

### Compiler-Level Optimizations
- `torch.compile()`: Leverage PyTorch's built-in compilation features to optimize the computational graph
- Experiment with different backends (inductor, cudagraph)
- Measure speedup from graph optimization and kernel fusion
- Compare compiled vs. non-compiled inference

### Custom Kernel Development
- CUDA Kernels: Implement custom CUDA kernels for critical operations (e.g., optimized attention mechanisms)
- Triton Kernels: Use Triton's higher-level abstractions to write performant kernels without low-level CUDA details
- Benchmark custom kernels against PyTorch's built-in implementations
- Use NCU to analyze achieved compute utilization

### Advanced Linear Algebra Optimizations
- Implement and benchmark optimized matrix multiplication kernels (e.g., using Tensor Cores more effectively)
- Experiment with mixed-precision operations
- Evaluate sparsity patterns and their impact on computation
- Compare against cuBLAS and other optimized libraries

### Model-Level Quantization
- Dynamic Quantization: Convert weights and activations to lower precision (INT8, FP8) at runtime
- Post-Training Quantization: Apply quantization without retraining, with calibration on representative data
- Quantization-Aware Training: Fine-tune models with simulated quantization for better accuracy preservation
- Benchmark different quantization schemes (symmetric, asymmetric, per-channel, per-tensor)
- Measure accuracy degradation on validation datasets alongside inference speedup
- Combine quantization with other optimizations (e.g., quantized + compiled models)
